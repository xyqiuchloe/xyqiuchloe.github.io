### Work Experience

** Biostatistician @ Henry Ford Health (_Aug 2023 - Present_)**
- Actively contributed to four cross-functional teams, assuming pivotal roles in statistical analysis, microbiome analysis, spatial transcriptomics analysis and single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Collaborated seamlessly with team members from diverse backgrounds to drive data-driven solutions and deliver actionable insights.
- Completed data cleaning and preprocessing efforts, handling large-scale questionnaire data from the 9,000+ CREW cohort subjects. This contributed to a 20% reduction in data processing time and 35% increase in data integrity.
-	Led comprehensive data analysis and applied statistical methods to extract insights from extensive healthcare datasets using R, resulting in the development of association models that result in a 10% enhancement in patient risk assessment accuracy.
- Authored detailed research reports summarizing data analysis findings, methodologies, and actionable insights for diverse research projects, created informative visualizations and interactive dashboards to communicate key findings to medical researchers, leading to a 20% improvement in data comprehension and facilitating informed decision-making.


** Computational Biology and Statistical Genetics Intern @ Takeda Pharmaceuticals (_May 2022 -  Aug 2022_)**
- Analyzed the impact of environmental and clinical factors on liver diseases, specifically liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Leveraged machine learning algorithms, resulting in a 11.2% increase in prediction accuracy.
- Preprocessed 58k clinical samples through missing value imputation and feature engineering, achieving a 19% reduction in classification errors; used SVM, Random Forest, ElasticNet models to classify important key factors; carried out protein association analysis using ANOVA models.
- Identified the top 30 key factors contributing to liver disease and quantified their impact on liver disease, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of disease mechanism and potential treatment targets.
- Presented project outcomes to senior leadership and GI Biomarker team, receiving recognition for the discovery's potential in drug evaluation.
